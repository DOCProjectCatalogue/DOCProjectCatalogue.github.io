# The Diabetes Online Community Technology Project Catalogue

This site lists the numerous independent\* and open source diabetes technology projects available. Hundreds of people have spent thousands upon thousands of hours building these tools for people with diabetes, their loved ones, and their care teams.

Not all of these projects are under active development. Many dormant projects still contain relevant code, however, and could be a jumping-off point for a completely new endeavor.

Projects are listed alphabetically.

\* _the definition of "independent" here is up for debate, but generally, projects that are commercial in nature are excluded from this list_
